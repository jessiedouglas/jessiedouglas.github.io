					<h1>About Me</h1>
					<p>
						I am a web developer based in New York. Born and raised in the beautiful countryside of West Virginia, I attended 
						Oberlin College, a small college located near Cleveland, OH, where I studied mathematics. After graduating, I moved to 
						North Carolina to attend Duke University and pursue a career as a high school math teacher. It was while attending Duke
						 that I took my first coding course and fell in love with it. After a year working as a full time teacher, I decided
						 that teaching was not for me, and I came to New York to pursue my new-found love of computer programming. Although I
						 am new to the profession, I am a quick learner and very excited to be in the field!
					</p>
					<p>
						Make sure to check out my projects page to see some of the projects I have already built, and take a look at my resume!
